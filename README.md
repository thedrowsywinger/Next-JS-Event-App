This will be an event showcasing website. 

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and combined with a [`Strapi`](https://strapi.io/) backend.

I am learning Next Js from a course by [`Traversy media`](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/) 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
cd next-js-event-frontend
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
